                <p>
                    I was born and raised in <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, in a village called Chkalovo (<i>Чкалово</i>),
                    located
                    300
                    km from the capital of the country Nur-Sułtan, in the north.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an early age, I started writing poetry. The oldest poems I have kept are from 2001, I was 9 at
                    the
                    time.
                    Until now I am writing in my native language - Russian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of my parents made every effort to bring up the best qualities in me. Dad taught me to do all
                    kinds
                    of
                    renovation works in the house and yard, to take care of domestic animals.
                    Mom taught me to cook, sew. She showed me the beauty of literature. Already at the age of 15, I was
                    delighted
                    with
                    <b>Dostoevsky's</b> depressive and very deep novels.

                <p>
                    At the age of 18, after graduating from high school, I successfully passed the entrance exams to
                    study
                    in
                    Poland.
                    After a year of <em>"compensatory"</em> study at the University of Rzeszów, I started my studies at
                    the
                    Warsaw
                    School of
                    Economics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my studies, I was very interested in football. I was a fan of FC Barcelona.
                    I had the opportunity to meet the entire Polish national team during <strong>2018 FIFA World Cup
                        qualification</strong>.

                    In 2017, I graduated with a "very good" master's degree in Project Management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started working during my undergraduate studies. I earned my first money by writing studies for
                    Russian
                    philology
                    students from my favorite Dostoyevsky's <em>"The Karamazovy Brothers"</em>. For the first money I
                    earned, I
                    bought skates.
